OpenEMR_Automation – BDD Cucumber Test Automation Framework
A robust and scalable UI automation framework built for the OpenEMR demo application. This project demonstrates advanced QA automation practices using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), focusing on healthcare workflows, secure authentication, and reliable UI validation.

🚀 Overview
OpenEMR_Automation is designed to automate critical workflows of an electronic medical record (EMR) system. It simulates real-world healthcare scenarios such as user login, patient management, and navigation across medical modules.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java

Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver

BDD Framework: Cucumber (Gherkin)

🎯 Test Coverage
This framework covers essential healthcare application workflows:

🔐 Authentication

Valid and invalid login scenarios
Session handling and logout validation

👤 Patient Management

Add new patient
Search and view patient records

🗂️ Dashboard & Navigation

Accessing different modules (Patients, Calendar, Messages)
Verifying page transitions

🧾 Form Handling

Input validation for patient forms
Handling dynamic fields and dropdowns

🎯 UI Validation

Element visibility, text assertions, and layout checks
⚙️ Framework Highlights
✔️ BDD implementation with Cucumber (Gherkin syntax)
✔️ Page Object Model (POM) for clean and maintainable code
✔️ Reusable step definitions and hooks
✔️ Parameterized locators for dynamic UI elements
✔️ TestNG integration for flexible execution
✔️ Maven for dependency and build management

▶️ Running the Tests
Using Maven
mvn clean test
Using TestNG Suite
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
Using IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ)
Right-click on the TestNG runner class
Select Run As → TestNG Test

📌 Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

Java (JDK 8 or higher)
Maven
Eclipse / IntelliJ IDE
Browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver)
🔐 Special Considerations
OpenEMR is a healthcare application, so test scenarios are designed to simulate realistic and sensitive workflows.
Focus on data validation, secure login handling, and UI reliability.
Avoid using real patient data—use only demo/test data provided by the application.
📈 Future Enhancements
Add reporting (Extent Reports / Allure Reports)
Integrate CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions)
Enable parallel test execution
Add cross-browser testing
Implement data-driven testing (Excel/JSON)
API testing integration (REST Assured)
Database validation (SQL)
